# Mock Completion Responses - Save Testing Costs

Trying to test making LLM Completion calls without calling the LLM APIs ? 
Pass `mock_response` to `llm.completion` and llm will directly return the response without neededing the call the LLM API and spend $$ 

## Using `completion()` with `mock_response`

```python
from llm import completion 

model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
messages = [{"role":"user", "content":"Why is LLM amazing?"}]

completion(model=model, messages=messages, mock_response="It's simple to use and easy to get started")
```

## Building a pytest function using `completion`

```python
from llm import completion
import pytest

def test_completion_openai():
    try:
        response = completion(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[{"role":"user", "content":"Why is LLM amazing?"}],
            mock_response="LLM is awesome"
        )
        # Add any assertions here to check the response
        print(response)
        print(response['choices'][0]['finish_reason'])
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"Error occurred: {e}")
```
